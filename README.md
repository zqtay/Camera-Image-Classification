# Camera-Image-Classification
A script to train a simple neural network to recognise various objects. Training data (images) are to be prepared in separate folders 
named by their respective categories. The network's accuracy and loss at each epoch can be visualised with Tensorboard. 
Camera is used to apply the trained model.

This script utilises Keras and OpenCV.
